    </p>
    <p class="p-b">
        All rental items must be ready for pick-up at scheduled times and placed into their original storage containers. If you do not have someone on-site at time of pick-up, it is common to have missing equipment at an event due to the number of people handling the equipment, including your guests, caterer, site personnel, cleaning crews and other people working the event. For your own satisfaction, it is best for care taking person from your side or appointed freelancer event planner from your side to count-in the equipment with our driver at pick-up so that you can verify any missing equipment at that time. If missing items are found after our scheduled pick-up, you are responsible for returning those items to our warehouse in a timely manner to avoid additional rental charges. We can return to your location and pick-up them for an additional charge. The lessee agrees to pay for any damage to, loss of, or any theft (disappearance) of items, regardless of cause or fault. Delivered items cannot be returned unless they have major defects and are non – functional.
